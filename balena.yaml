  ## Introduction

  Kerberos.io is a cutting edge video surveillance system with a strong focus on user experience, scalability, resilience, extension and integration. Kerberos.io provides different solutions, but from a high level point of view it comes into two flavours: Kerberos Agent and Kerberos Enterprise Suite. Bottom line Kerberos Enterprise Suite extends Kerberos Agent with additional components such as Kerberos Factory, Kerberos Vault and Kerberos Hub.

  ### Kerberos Agent

  - Installation in seconds (Docker, Balena, Snap, etc).
  - Simplified and modern user interface.
  - Multi architecture (ARMv7, ARMv8, amd64, etc).
  - Multi camera support: IP Cameras (MJPEG/H264), USB cameras and Raspberry Pi Cameras through a RTSP proxy.
  - Single camera per instance (e.g. One Docker container per camera).
  - Integrations (Webhooks, MQTT, Script, etc).
  - Cloud storage (Kerberos Hub, Kerberos Vault, Minio, Storj, etc).
  - MIT License

  ### Kerberos Factory (part of [Kerberos Enterprise suite](https://doc.kerberos.io/enterprise/first-things-first/))

  - Installation on top of Kubernetes (K8S).
  - Camera support for IP camera only (RTSP/H264).
  - Massive horizontal scaling, thanks to Kubernetes.
  - Management of multiple Kerberos Agents through a single pane of glass.
  - Low memory and CPU intensive.
  - Modular and extensible design for building own extensions and integrations (e.g. a video analytics platform).
  - Commercial licensed and closed source.

  ## How it works: A world of Agents üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

  Kerberos.io applies the concept of agents. An agent is running next to or on your camera, and is processing a single camera feed. It applies motion based recording and make those recordings available through a user friendly web interface. Kerberos Agent allows you to connect to other cloud services or custom applications. Kerberos Agent is perfect for personal usage and/or is a great tool if you only have a couple of surveillance cameras to be processed.

  If you are looking for a solution that scales better with your video surveillance and/or video analytics requirements, [Kerberos Enterprise Suite might be a better fit](https://doc.kerberos.io/enterprise/first-things-first).
